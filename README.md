# The Realm Generator
If you've ever played a tabletop roleplaying game, then you may have encountered a common problem: you haven't got the time to invent a realm. And I don't mean a realm with a single great dynasty in it; I mean *hundreds* of noble families, *thousands* of nobles and courtiers, complex relationships between them, feuds, alliances, loose factions, hierarchies...it's work.

### The Realm Generator.

In a single click, you can generate a complex, interwoven realm filled with intrigue, ready for any tabletop gaming experience.

[In fact, you can do it right now, without having to build anything. Check it out!](https://infinite-woodland-34884.herokuapp.com/)

## Building

Building the code is easy enough. Assuming the use of Python 3, check out the code, change to the source directory, and then:

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    export FLASK_APP=app.py
    flask run

And, you're running. Easy peasy.

## A few notes on names
